<h1>Spandana Pandi acts in a play</h1>
<h4 >An Enemy of the People</h4>
<h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4>
<h5>Hovstad.</h5><p>Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?</p>
<h5>Billing.</h5><p>Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>
 <h5>Hovstad.</h5><p>Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
first blow.</p>
<h5>Billing.</h5><p>That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</p>
<h5>Hovstad.</h5>
<p>(turning round).</p>
<p>Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.</p>
<h5>Billing.</h5>
<p>(lowering his voice).</p>
<p> Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?</p>
<h5>Hovstad.</h5><p>Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—</p>
<h5>Billing.</h5><p>That will be the devil of a nuisance.</p>
